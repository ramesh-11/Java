Question 1 :
Write main method in Solution class.

In the main method, write code to read a numeric digit(without any alphabets or special characters) using Scanner and print it in the reverse sequence as they appear in the input.

Consider below sample input and output:

Input:
12345

Output:
Reverse of the number is 54321

```java
import java.util.*; 
public class MyClass{ 
  public static void main(String args[]){ 
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); 
    int n = sc.nextInt(); 
    int rev = 0; 
    while(n>0){ 
      rev = rev*10; 
      rev = rev + n%10; 
      n = n/10; 
    } 
    System.out.println("Reverse of the number is "+rev); 
  } 
}
```
